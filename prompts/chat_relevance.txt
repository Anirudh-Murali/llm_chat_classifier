I will provide you with multiple chat threads and a new query,
                    you will compare each chat history with the new query and return the chat title of the chat history that is most relevant.
                    After receiving this prompt you must request me to provide another chat history or a new query. I will provide chat history in the following format

```
chat title: {chat_title}
```
I will provide a new query as 
```
new query: {new_query}
```
Remember, you must only return the chat title of the most relevant chat. The expected response is in the following format

```chat_title: {chat_title}```
